            <h2>Crafted in Romania. Designed for the World.</h2>
            <p>
                In 2020, a vision was born — one that dared to challenge conventions and reimagine the Romanian
                automotive identity.
                With passion, engineering precision, and bold creativity, TM Motors took its first steps toward becoming a
                symbol of modern mobility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission was simple yet ambitious: to build vehicles that transcend trends, embody timeless elegance,
                and empower the driver at every turn.
                And now, five years later, that mission becomes reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the hills of Transylvania to the Black Sea, Romania has long been a land of builders, inventors,
                and dreamers.
                TM Motors carries that spirit forward — fueled by a new generation of engineers and designers who believe
                that global excellence can be crafted at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our story began with more than an idea — it began with purpose. Every decision we make, from the drawing
                board to the test track, reflects our dedication
                to redefining what a Romanian-made vehicle can be in the eyes of the world.

            <h2>2025 — Our First Chapter Begins</h2>
            <p>
                This year marks the launch of our debut models — <strong>Elyssion</strong>, the refined sedan designed
                for urban sophistication,
                and <strong>Teraon</strong>, the bold SUV engineered for every journey. Each line, each surface, each
                innovation speaks to our design philosophy:
                intelligent, intuitive, and inherently human.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are more than vehicles. They are the beginning of a new era in Romanian automotive excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The launch of Elyssion and Teraon is not only a technological milestone — it's the realization of years
                of planning, prototyping, and refinement.
                These two models are the voice of a brand that believes in progress, elegance, and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designed, engineered, and assembled with care, these vehicles prove that premium automotive design
                doesn’t need to come from outside — it can start here, in Romania.

            <h2>Elyssion — Elegance in Motion</h2>
            <p>
                Elyssion is the definition of balance — between form and function, performance and comfort. Its sculpted
                silhouette glides effortlessly through city streets,
                while its luxurious interior offers a serene space shaped by your preferences. Available in a range of
                curated exterior colors and customizable interiors,
                Elyssion is a statement of personality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether powered by our <strong>Petrol 2.0 TSX</strong> or <strong>Diesel 2.0 TDX</strong> engine, every
                Elyssion delivers refined dynamics and responsive power.
                A sedan crafted for those who expect more from every drive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the Elyssion, drivers will find a space that merges contemporary luxury with cutting-edge
                comfort. Ambient lighting, customizable displays, and intelligent climate control
                systems respond to your every move. It’s not just a car — it’s a curated experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sound insulation, ergonomic seating, and soft-touch surfaces create a tranquil environment, whether
                you're commuting to work or escaping the city on a weekend drive.
                Elyssion is serenity in motion — understated on the outside, unforgettable on the inside.

            <h2>Teraon — Presence. Performance. Possibility.</h2>
            <p>
                Teraon was built to command attention. With a bold exterior stance, spacious interior, and smart
                technology, it's more than an SUV — it's an invitation to explore.
                Every journey becomes a story, whether you're navigating urban streets or venturing beyond the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designed for versatility and strength, powered by the same proven technology as Elyssion, Teraon blends
                elegance and capability into a truly Romanian performance vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teraon is made for those who demand more — more space, more freedom, more confidence. Its high ground
                clearance, adaptive suspension, and intelligent drive modes
                make it as capable on a forest trail as it is in urban traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Smart loading zones, wireless charging, and modular storage enhance every trip. Whether you're carrying
                passengers, gear, or ambition — Teraon is ready to adapt.

            <p>
                At TM Motors, innovation is not about complexity — it's about clarity. From adaptive driver-assist
                features to real-time diagnostics and connected interfaces,
                our technology is engineered to enhance your driving experience, not overwhelm it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every vehicle is crafted with a sense of anticipation — understanding what you need before you ask for
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe innovation should anticipate, not intimidate. That’s why we’ve built an ecosystem where voice
                control, predictive navigation, and AI-powered suggestions
                adapt to your routines, offering assistance exactly when it’s needed.

            <p>
                Over-the-air updates ensure your TM Motors vehicle continues to improve over time, with security patches,
                feature upgrades, and system enhancements delivered remotely and safely.

            <h2>Responsibility in Every Detail</h2>
            <p>
                Sustainability is not a feature — it’s a foundation. Our production facilities are built with energy
                efficiency in mind, our materials are sourced responsibly,
                and we are committed to reducing emissions across our entire value chain.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that luxury and responsibility must go hand in hand. That’s why our future includes not just
                hybrids — but fully electric vehicles designed with the same soul as our originals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our hybrid platforms already reduce emissions significantly, and we are actively developing a fully
                electric architecture to lead the charge into a greener future.
                From paint to packaging, every element of our production pipeline is scrutinized for its impact — and
                improved accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Partnering with local suppliers and renewable energy providers, TM Motors is building a future that’s not
                only intelligent — but responsible.

            </p>
            <p>
                In the coming years, our roadmap includes full electrification, autonomous driving support, and a suite
                of digital services designed to connect car, user, and world.
                We are investing in infrastructure, expanding our network of service partners, and building a new
                research campus in Brașov.
            </p>
            <p>
                With every new milestone, we’re driven by the same principle that started it all: mobility is not just
                about moving — it’s about moving forward with intention, innovation, and integrity.
